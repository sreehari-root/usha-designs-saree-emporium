## 2. LITERATURE SURVEY

### 2.1 EXISTING AND PROPOSED SYSTEM

**Existing System Analysis:**

Traditional ethnic wear businesses primarily operate through physical stores with limited online presence. Current challenges include:

4. **Marketing:** Traditional marketing methods with limited digital presence
5. **Order Processing:** Manual order handling causing delays and errors

**Existing E-commerce Platforms:**
- Amazon, Flipkart: General marketplaces with limited ethnic wear focus
- Myntra, Ajio: Fashion-focused but lacking traditional wear specialization
- Nykaa Fashion: Beauty-focused with limited ethnic wear collection

**Proposed System Advantages:**

1. **Specialized Platform:** Dedicated to traditional Indian ethnic wear
2. **Global Reach:** 24/7 accessibility worldwide
3. **Enhanced User Experience:** Advanced search, filtering, and product visualization

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION

### 6.1 CODE SNIPPETS

**React Component Example - Product Card:**

```typescript
// src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Heart, ShoppingCart } from 'lucide-react';

interface ProductCardProps {
  product: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    image_url: string;
    description: string;
  };
  onAddToCart: (productId: string) => void;
  onAddToWishlist: (productId: string) => void;
}

export const ProductCard: React.FC<ProductCardProps> = ({
  product,
  onAddToCart,
  onAddToWishlist
}) => {
  return (
    <Card className="group hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow duration-300">
      <CardContent className="p-4">
        <div className="aspect-square overflow-hidden rounded-lg mb-4">
          <img
            src={product.image_url}

        </h3>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3 line-clamp-2">
          {product.description}
        </p>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <span className="text-xl font-bold text-primary">
            ₹{product.price.toLocaleString()}
          </span>
          <div className="flex gap-2">
